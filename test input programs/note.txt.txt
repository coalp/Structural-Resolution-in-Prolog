Test Notes:

%  S-resolution's non-termination behaviour for program marriage_loop.pl. 
     S-resolution gets into infinite loop for some query. See marriage_loop.pl source file for detail.
    
     Similar behaviour is observed with p_rec2.pl.

% implementation of both S-resolution and SLD doesn't terminate for numeral(X) with numeral2.pl where 
    numbers are represented by 0 and successor funtion and the inductive rule is placed before the base fact.

% natural numbers defined with successor function could be denumerated by S-resolution, while 
    natural numbers defined by arithmetic numbers can't be due to inference mechanism. SLD resolution 
    can denumerate in both of the above cases. a successsful attempt was made to devise a natural number
    generator suitable for execution with S-resolution. See arithmatic_nat_for_s_reso.pl

% When I tried to test with lexicon_parse_tree.pl and print_english_parse_tree.pl, which shall be consulted
    together, I tried to make these files into modules. But under the module setting the meta-interpreter was confused
    by namespace labels. I then kept the meta-interpreter as a module and stopped letting the test files be module.
    I manually consulted the meta-interpreter module and then manually loaded the  test files. This time it worked fine. 
 
    The input file for the meta-intepreter should not be made a module otherwise the interpreter is likely to has problem 
    access the predicates in a right form.
